The R script titled "Fission-Track-Age-Analysis" carries out a comprehensive analysis of fission track dating by leveraging data from two CSV files, DUR.csv and zcfbyhs.csv. Initially, the script calculates the calibration factor (S) by using the decay constant (λ) and other geological parameters, followed by determining the age of the sample (zcfbyhs). The analysis also includes uncertainty calculations such as analytic uncertainty and standard deviation, which are vital for assessing the reliability of the age estimates.

Further, the script evaluates the precision of different dating methods—U238Pb206, U235Pb207, and 40Ar39Ar—by computing percentage uncertainties and standard errors. Through this comparison, it is evident that the 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb methods show much lower uncertainty percentages and standard errors compared to the fission track method, indicating their superior precision. The fission track method, while useful, exhibits higher uncertainty, which may be attributed to a smaller sample size in the analysis. Overall, the script underscores the relative precision of these dating methods, with 40Ar/39Ar emerging as the most precise, followed by U-Pb, and finally, the fission track method.
